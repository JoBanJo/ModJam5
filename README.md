This mod was made for ModJam 5 in three days, so forgive any bugs! This branch contains the code as it was at the end of the modjam.

Adds three types of drones:
1. Hauler drone: searches items in the world and brings them to its home.
2. Fighter drone: fights mobs around it.
3. Tree farm drone: plants trees and chops them down.
It sets it home where you place it. 

This mod also adds a drone stick this can do a couple different things:
1. Select drones by right clicking on them (Deselect by shift-rightclicking in air)
2. Set home of selected drones by right clicking on block.
3. Kill drone by shift-right clicking on drone.
